# Handover: Movie Night Spinner

Read this first in a new chat. Last updated 4 Nov 2026.

## Where things are

- Repo: jlaw8787/movie-night-spinner
- Launch branch: wip/menu-polish (917768a22)
- Work branch: wip/store-overhaul, everything pushed. It sits on top of menu-polish. main has one extra commit (d30fb02ac) that merges in clean.
- Live on Netlify while GitHub is flagged: https://movie-night-spinner.netlify.app (Netlify project "movie-night-spinner"). Deployed 4 Nov from wip/store-overhaul (4def937). To redeploy, use the Netlify connector's deploy-site on that project and run the command it gives from the repo folder. Plain static site, no build step.
- GitHub account is still flagged, so Pages is down. When it clears:
  1. Merge wip/menu-polish into main
  2. Run the tests
  3. Push and check Pages
  4. Merge wip/store-overhaul on top

## The to-do

All 15 items in docs/review-2.md are done (3 Nov evening, notes against each item). Review 3 is worked through. Review 4 (8 out of 10, docs/review-4.md) is worked through on 4 Nov, notes against each item. Fifth review: 8.1 out of 10 (docs/review-5.md). Next: work down docs/review-5.md one item at a time, commit and push after each.

Left open from review 2, closed 4 Nov: sequel prices (checked: same-layout sequels already rise with the year; Crocodile Dundee II is a campfire out bush, cheaper than the Walkabout Creek pub on purpose); films with no good still (only Kenny has none and three have one, and posters cover all four, so no fallback needed); the missing assets/band.png (now a gingham strip on the Julie & Julia menu). Shopping lines now always read as one amount: spoons fold into weights or cups, counts round up, counted produce uses standard weights, herbs go by the bunch.

## Things added on 3 Nov (so they are not undone by accident)

- data/film-house.json: two house lines per shared-layout film (table item, drink) with a film note; `fit` lists which ones fit without hiding the film's own notes. Generic Fries, Bottomless coffee, Bread and butter, Tea or coffee are gone on purpose.
- app.js fitLines (shrinks one-line text to fit, never under 65%), foldClear (tiki rows off creases), nbRange (number ranges never split), libVary (per-venue wording of stock notices, never longer than the original line).
- Josh's rule: Easter eggs and the film's own dish notes come first. Only house lines drop when a layout runs out of room, never a dish.
- Phone printed menus: one page per screen with swipe and dots; the full size view opens at fit to width with pinch zoom.
- Fold menus (takeaway, tiki and the hand-built fold PDFs): no text on a crease, checked on all 42.
- Desktop: shorter marquee framed on the letter board; weekly strips, checklist and stubs in the right column.

## Rules Josh has set

- Two brands, never mixed. Cinema (Movie Night Spinner: box office, wheel, marquee, candy bar) is red and gold. Galaxy Video (the store) is purple, gold, teal and pink.
- No em dashes anywhere, in chat, code or files.
- Plain, direct Australian tone. No AI-sounding phrasing.
- Questions as tappable pop-ups, one at a time.
- Short need-to-know replies first.
- Lock a direction once set, no drift. Josh watches token spend.
- Spell it "Weeklys".
- Real brands and TMDB posters are in. Josh likes posters on the menus (turned back on 3 Nov, LIB_POSTER_ON in app.js). Do not remove them.
- Shared menus use period prices, not year-coded ones.
- Phones show the printed menu first, then the text menu.
- Menus: show all dishes, cook 5.
- Candy bar and aisle real photos are deferred until free real photos turn up.
- Printed extras (table kit and so on) parked.

## How to work in the repo

- Vanilla JS single page: index.html (CSS and markup), app.js, films.js (generated), formats.js and formats-core.js (hand-built menus), menu-formats/*.js (30 shared layouts).
- Data sources: data/films.json, data/film-flavour.json (source of venue, sign and so on for shared menus), data/film-format.json. data/film/*.json is generated, never hand edit it.
- After any JS or data change run `node scripts/build-data.cjs`. It regenerates files and stamps ?v= cache hashes in index.html and sw.js.
- Tests: `node --check app.js`, then every tests/*.test.cjs except dialogs.test.cjs. Never write the text "app.js" in an index.html comment (a test checks script order).
- Local server: `python3 -m http.server 4190` from the repo.
- TMDB key lives at /home/claude/.tmdb_key. Pass it as TMDB_KEY env var. Never commit it.
- Commits: `git -c user.name=Josh -c user.email=joshdl_87@hotmail.com commit`.
- Logo sources: scripts/brand (flat vector SVG in HTML, render with render.py). Shop sign: scripts/compose-shopfront-real.py. Member card and sticker: scripts/compose-brand-extras.py.
- Photo credits: assets/hero/PHOTO-CREDITS.md and the site footer.

## Later

- Update the Design canvases with the new real photos and logo.
- Update og:image and URLs when the domain is bought.
- Accounts plan, app store apps, Box Office Bites social series: see Josh's notes.

## Added 4 Nov

- Sound starts off until the speaker is tapped (Josh's call). Stored as mns-sound "1".
- Untested extra dishes shop in their own last group, "For the extras, buy to suit".
- Phone half views of wide menus hide badly cut words and fade the cut edge (pvMask in app.js).
- Wheel redraws when its canvas resizes or the box office view returns.
- Review 5 fixes: diet switches redraw the card; step counts, packs, frying oil and hands-on time scale; layout wording fits the film (flavour beach, ride, sport, coin); film numbers only set the cents on period prices; extras merge into the shopping list; cook time from heat steps (tests/cook-times.test.cjs); bases like risotto and cooked rice shop as raw with a base step; water off the list; phone text menu uses the Prep sheet recipe; Galaxy Video new releases $4 for 3 nights.
- scripts/check-browser.cjs now builds one film per layout plus The Godfather and opens each Prep sheet. Keep it passing.
- 4 Nov afternoon: Print builds the finished PDF and prints that (printPdf in app.js), with 5mm margins and an ink-friendly prep sheet (inkSafe). Lock in asks "Director's cut" or "The full feature" (lockAsk). Table kit prints in its own colours. Kids' mode swaps whole drink names first (shared list at the top of each DRY). Canteen has army mess and prison days. House lines drop when their main noun matches a card dish. Tips for kids and non-drinkers sit under the method, untimed.

## 4 Nov, late afternoon
- Review 7's fix list is done (fixes 6 to 10), noted in docs/review-7.md, and deployed to Netlify (app.js?v=f3f14dd9).
- New shared helper: window.priceSense(menu,P) in app.js keeps card prices in order (mains over starters and sweets, spirits over plain drinks and sweets); used by truck, kiosk, lab, cafe and hotel.
- Shopping lines: PREP_TAIL strips prep words, STAPLE_RE lists salt and pepper with no amount, spoons round to halves, green and ripe fruit share one line.
- fullMenu: a card with one main shows the film's second main before a third starter.
- Table kit review done: docs/review-8.md (6.5 out of 10). All 8 fixes done 4 Nov, noted at the end of review-8.md.
- New kit helpers in app.js: kitFit (names shrink or go to two lines, departures cells fit) and kitReady (mounts kit pages offscreen, retries refused stills, runs kitFit and the dry pass). Kit Print now goes through printPdf like the menus.
