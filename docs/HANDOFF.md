# Handover: Movie Night Spinner

Read this first in a new chat. Last updated 4 Nov 2026.

## Where things are

- Repo: jlaw8787/movie-night-spinner
- Launch branch: wip/menu-polish (917768a22)
- Work branch: wip/store-overhaul, everything pushed. It sits on top of menu-polish. main has one extra commit (d30fb02ac) that merges in clean.
- GitHub account is still flagged, so Pages is down. When it clears:
  1. Merge wip/menu-polish into main
  2. Run the tests
  3. Push and check Pages
  4. Merge wip/store-overhaul on top

## The to-do

All 15 items in docs/review-2.md are done (3 Nov evening, notes against each item). Review 3 is worked through. Review 4 (8 out of 10, docs/review-4.md) is worked through on 4 Nov, notes against each item. Next: a fifth review, or merge to main once the GitHub flag clears.

Left open from review 2: matching prices across sequels (low impact), the fallback photo treatment for films with no good still, and (fixed 3 Nov) the 3 browser checks: two were out of date with the shopping list format, the third found a real bug where closing the rental slip stepped browser history back one extra entry and could leave the app. All tests and browser checks now pass.

## Things added on 3 Nov (so they are not undone by accident)

- data/film-house.json: two house lines per shared-layout film (table item, drink) with a film note; `fit` lists which ones fit without hiding the film's own notes. Generic Fries, Bottomless coffee, Bread and butter, Tea or coffee are gone on purpose.
- app.js fitLines (shrinks one-line text to fit, never under 65%), foldClear (tiki rows off creases), nbRange (number ranges never split), libVary (per-venue wording of stock notices, never longer than the original line).
- Josh's rule: Easter eggs and the film's own dish notes come first. Only house lines drop when a layout runs out of room, never a dish.
- Phone printed menus: one page per screen with swipe and dots; the full size view opens at fit to width with pinch zoom.
- Fold menus (takeaway, tiki and the hand-built fold PDFs): no text on a crease, checked on all 42.
- Desktop: shorter marquee framed on the letter board; weekly strips, checklist and stubs in the right column.

## Rules Josh has set

- Two brands, never mixed. Cinema (Movie Night Spinner: box office, wheel, marquee, candy bar) is red and gold. Galaxy Video (the store) is purple, gold, teal and pink.
- No em dashes anywhere, in chat, code or files.
- Plain, direct Australian tone. No AI-sounding phrasing.
- Questions as tappable pop-ups, one at a time.
- Short need-to-know replies first.
- Lock a direction once set, no drift. Josh watches token spend.
- Spell it "Weeklys".
- Real brands and TMDB posters are in. Josh likes posters on the menus (turned back on 3 Nov, LIB_POSTER_ON in app.js). Do not remove them.
- Shared menus use period prices, not year-coded ones.
- Phones show the printed menu first, then the text menu.
- Menus: show all dishes, cook 5.
- Candy bar and aisle real photos are deferred until free real photos turn up.
- Printed extras (table kit and so on) parked.

## How to work in the repo

- Vanilla JS single page: index.html (CSS and markup), app.js, films.js (generated), formats.js and formats-core.js (hand-built menus), menu-formats/*.js (30 shared layouts).
- Data sources: data/films.json, data/film-flavour.json (source of venue, sign and so on for shared menus), data/film-format.json. data/film/*.json is generated, never hand edit it.
- After any JS or data change run `node scripts/build-data.cjs`. It regenerates files and stamps ?v= cache hashes in index.html and sw.js.
- Tests: `node --check app.js`, then every tests/*.test.cjs except dialogs.test.cjs. Never write the text "app.js" in an index.html comment (a test checks script order).
- Local server: `python3 -m http.server 4190` from the repo.
- TMDB key lives at /home/claude/.tmdb_key. Pass it as TMDB_KEY env var. Never commit it.
- Commits: `git -c user.name=Josh -c user.email=joshdl_87@hotmail.com commit`.
- Logo sources: scripts/brand (flat vector SVG in HTML, render with render.py). Shop sign: scripts/compose-shopfront-real.py. Member card and sticker: scripts/compose-brand-extras.py.
- Photo credits: assets/hero/PHOTO-CREDITS.md and the site footer.

## Later

- Update the Design canvases with the new real photos and logo.
- Update og:image and URLs when the domain is bought.
- Accounts plan, app store apps, Box Office Bites social series: see Josh's notes.

## Added 4 Nov

- Sound starts off until the speaker is tapped (Josh's call). Stored as mns-sound "1".
- Untested extra dishes shop in their own last group, "For the extras, buy to suit".
- Phone half views of wide menus hide badly cut words and fade the cut edge (pvMask in app.js).
- Wheel redraws when its canvas resizes or the box office view returns.
